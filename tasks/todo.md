# Historical todo: courier-run-eta (loop 19)

- [x] spec: wrong ETA on multi-parcel runs measured in code (useRoad, /track eta)
- [x] server + client
- [x] tests: parcels.test.mjs (run flag, eta, last stop, finished, single job); 3/3 mutants killed; npm test, tsc, lint
- [x] screens (78); A53 Chrome public page (Arabic): run line, no minutes; order page en (built-in browser, phone in owner's hands): run line, ETA back on the last stop; iPhone guide hidden on Android browsers
- [x] ship (deploy eb841dcb). Order-page change reaches Android in the next APK
