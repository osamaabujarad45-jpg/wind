# Restore and database recovery

PostgreSQL Flexible Server point-in-time restore and Blob recovery are infrastructure capabilities, not restore evidence. Before paid launch, operators must perform and record a fresh restore into a separate, isolated resource group and verify application-level reconciliation, PostGIS extension availability, counts, money balances/open obligations, active custody, returns, events/outbox, evidence references, timestamps and Arabic text. Record source backup window, restore point, operator, elapsed RTO, observed data-loss interval/RPO and application revision. No real restore was run by this preparation task.

1. Declare incident and freeze new writes/dispatch through the approved application control; keep custody and finance access staffed.
2. Select a restore point from the incident timeline and create a separate server using the documented Azure PostgreSQL restore procedure: <https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/backup-restore/how-to-restore-server-portal>.
3. Keep ingress closed. Verify TLS, private DNS/network path, PostGIS required extensions, schema/migration state, and least-privilege operator access.
4. Run the repository's reviewed reconciliation/import checks against the restored server and compare domain counts, balanced ledgers, active assignments/custody, returns, idempotency, event/outbox continuity, and Blob object references.
5. Test API/worker behavior against the restored copy without real provider calls. Verify no fallback to stale SQLite.
6. Obtain owner approval for a controlled recovery cutover. Preserve the source server read-only for investigation under the approved retention policy.

## Import rehearsal (T34) and the pre-T28 refund carry-forward

The repository rehearses the SQLite→PostgreSQL import continuously: `tests/pg-import.mjs` takes a consistent SQLite snapshot, imports it into an isolated PostgreSQL schema (`server/migrate.ts`), reconciles counts, money totals, open custody and rounding exceptions exactly, then proves `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` restore plus API parity over HTTP; `tests/pg-migration-lock.mjs` proves the migration CLI waits through a concurrent advisory lock and stays retry-safe. A real rehearsal adds the authorized live snapshot and the operator record above — the automated rehearsal alone is not cutover approval.

Two reconciliation duties belong to the rehearsal before the payments gate opens (T28/T50 carry-forward):

- **Pre-T28 `rejected` refund rows are not retro-reserved.** Any refund row written `rejected` under the old contract must be reconciled against the provider's own statements before the payments capability is enabled on the imported data; the provider, not the legacy row, decides whether that money moved.
- **Rollback after new PostgreSQL writes never points back at stale SQLite.** Once the API writes to PostgreSQL, the SQLite file is an archival copy only: recovery follows step 2-6 against PostgreSQL backups, and the imported SQLite snapshot is never re-promoted (the runtime has no production SQLite fallback branch).

Recovery objectives are not set by this IaC. The operator must approve numeric RPO/RTO based on a timed fresh restore before production. Flexible Server backup retention is configured by environment; geo-redundant backup is disabled pending regional/data-location review. Blob redundancy/lifecycle, soft delete/versioning, quarantine scanning and evidence retention also require explicit policy/cost approval. No recovery is complete solely because Azure reports a backup or deployment succeeded.
